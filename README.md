2048-3D
=======

I started this not so long ago, but work has halted already! This is due to the fact that I'm very busy right now with other things. I will probably continue this project at some point though I do not know when yet! Right now there is nothing remotely functional about the game (aside from the fact it doesn't crash on launch!).

The popular game 2048 for the 3DS.(NINJHAX)

This is currently in it's early alpha version, you should always be able to compile the code and use the .3dsx version! If one of these is inpossible please create an isue on this repo so I can fix it.

Currently the project in not yet on github, this will be added sometime soon.

Plans:
Text version (Not done)
Add basic GFX (Not done)
Animations (Not done)
Add better GFX (Not done)
Polish! (Not done)
